STEPS:
1. Right after you open VSCode, FIRST thing to do: git pull   (so that you have the most up to date repo to start working with again)
2. After you're done working on a file: git add 'filename'    (repeat this step for every file you edited and want to push)
3. Commit the files: git commit -m 'put message here in quotes'
4. Push the file(s): git push

Type the commands in precisely as above and follow the order above!

Other Helpful Commands:
1. git status   -Let's you see the state of all your files, ie: what files have been edited but not comitted, which ones are comitted but not pushed, etc
2. git log      -Let's you see the entire commit history of the repo, ie: who comitted when, and more
