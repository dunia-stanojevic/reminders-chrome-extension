STEPS:
1. Open Terminal and make sure you're inside the repository. The new line should look something like this -> PS C:\Users\Mayra\reminders-chrome-extension>
2. Now, once you're in the repo, FIRST thing to do: git pull   (so that you have the most up to date repo to start working with again)
3. After you're done working on a file: git add 'filename'    (repeat this step for every file you edited and want to push)
4. Commit the files: git commit -m 'put message here in quotes'
5. Push the file(s): git push

Type the commands in precisely as above and follow the order above!
